# Face-detection-Unlocking PC/ Laptop

## Basic requirements:
**Hardware** : Working PC/ Laptop with **Webcam**

**Software**:  
- Python (modules- **NumPy**, **OpenCV3**)
- **haarcascade_frontalface_default** - A Haar Cascade is a machine learning approach where a cascade function is trained from a huge 
set of positive and negative images and is applied on new set of images.
This uses **Adaboost training** (similar to **Gradient Boosted Trees**) which selects the most important features to shorten the execution time. 
   
- **Setting up openCV** :

> Find your ***cv2.py*** file.
> Your CV2 file should be found here - C:\opencv\build\python\2.7\x64

> Copy this cv2.py file and place it in the following directory (main directory will be where your python.exe is located)-
> C:\Users\user-name\Anaconda2\Lib\site-packages

For Anaconda Environment:

> conda install -c conda-forge opencv

> conda install -c michael_wild opencv-contrib
